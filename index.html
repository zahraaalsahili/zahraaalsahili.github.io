    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London and a DeepMind PhD Scholar, specializing in Vision Language Foundation Models focusing on fairness and trustworthy ML. My passion for 'AI for Good' drives me to explore innovative solutions in machine learning, aiming to enhance fairness, trustworthiness, and the integration of AI in medical applications. My research includes projects on transfer learning, computer vision, and graph neural networks, reflecting my commitment to leveraging technology to address real-world challenges.



    </p>
    <p>
I hold a Master's Degree from the American University of Beirut, where I also served as a teaching assistant in programming and data structures. I have been actively involved in teaching at various academic levels and have collaborated with platforms like deeplearning.ai to develop and test new machine learning curricula.
